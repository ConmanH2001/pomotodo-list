                A Pomodoro timer is a type of timer that gives you a 25 minute work time and a 5 minute break.
                After abput four of those breaks you usually get a 15 minute break, then after 4 of those is a 30 minute break.
                This will be a timer but it will also have a todo list that shows what you have to do, what you have completed,
                and the percentage of what has been completed.
